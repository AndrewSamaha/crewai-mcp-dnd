    "background": "The story of Errotin takes place in a world where magic is real and powerful but only a few can wield it. It is the steel age, with no electricity or automobiles or even gas lamps. Most make their living as farmers or sailors or merchants. Much of the world is sparsely populated, towns and villages are separated by at least a few days travel on horse. The wild between settlements is filled with danger and adventure."

	"description": "The Dark Hollow is a chilling space on the road between Varatoba and Unka. As adventurers approach, they feel the weight of the shadows around them. The air is thick with tension, and the faint howls of wolves echo through the trees, sending shivers down their spines. The hollow is known for its ancient trees that twist into unnatural shapes, creating an eerie canopy overhead. Travelers have reported seeing eyes watching them from the darkness, and stories of disappearances have become common talk in Varatoba's Inn.",
